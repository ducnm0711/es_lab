Highly Available Authenticated Elasticsearch 6.8 Cluster
Objectives Summary

    Deploy a Highly Available Elasticsearch 6.8 Cluster
    Ensure Cluster Authentication

Choice of Tech Stack

    Elasticsearch 6.8: Search and analytics capabilities
    Elastic Stack's Built-in Security Features: Authentication and authorization
    Docker: Containerization for simplified deployment and management
    Kubernetes: Orchestration for high availability and robust features
    NGINX: Reverse proxy for external access and additional security layer
    Let's Encrypt: SSL/TLS certificates for enhanced security

Actual Solution
1. Infrastructure Setup

    Provision 3+ Nodes (e.g., VMs or cloud instances) for high availability
    Install Docker on each node
    Set up a Kubernetes Cluster (using e.g., kubeadm) for orchestration

2. Elasticsearch Cluster Deployment

    Create a Docker Compose File for Elasticsearch:
    + Defines 3+ Elasticsearch service instances (one per node)
    + Configures zen discovery mechanism for node discovery
    + Enables Elasticsearch's Built-in Security Features (xpack.security.enabled: true)
    + Mounts persistent storage volumes for data durability
    Apply Kubernetes Deployment YAML:
    + Translate Docker Compose configuration to Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, Persistent Volume Claims)

3. Authentication and Authorization Setup

    Configure Elasticsearch's Built-in User Authentication:
    + Create roles and users (e.g., elastic, kibana, logstash, custom roles)
    + Assign appropriate permissions to roles
    Enable SSL/TLS for Elasticsearch:
    + Obtain certificates from Let's Encrypt
    + Configure Elasticsearch to use certificates for encrypted communications

4. Reverse Proxy with NGINX for External Access

    Deploy NGINX as a Kubernetes Service or standalone Docker container
    Configure NGINX:
    + As a reverse proxy to the Elasticsearch Service
    + To enforce HTTPS (using Let's Encrypt certificates)
    + Optionally, integrate with Elasticsearch's authentication for end-to-end security

5. Monitoring and Logging (Optional but Recommended)

    Integrate with Elastic Stack's Monitoring for cluster health insights
    Configure Logging (e.g., with Filebeat) to a central log analysis platform

Key Takeaways

    High Availability: Multi-node setup orchestrated by Kubernetes
    Authentication: Provided by Elasticsearch's built-in security features
    Security: Enhanced with end-to-end encryption (SSL/TLS) via Let's Encrypt certificates and a reverse proxy (NGINX)
